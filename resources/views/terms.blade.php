<p><strong>3. Description of the Services</strong></p>

<p>The Mint Service is a personal finance information management service that allows you to consolidate and track your financial information. The Mint Service is provided to you by Intuit without charge (it is free) and is meant to provide you with your information to allow you to organize and manage your finances.</p>

<p>The Mint Service may also include a service that provides your one-bureau credit summary, credit score and monitoring alerts (“Credit Score Service”). You may have the option to obtain this Credit Score Service for free or elect to purchase an upgraded version of this service that provides you information from multiple credit bureaus (“Mint Credit Monitoring”).</p>

<p>The Bill Payment Services offers various tools and functions through the Sites including a personal information management service that allows you to consolidate and track certain personal information. It also includes a bill payment service that allows you to make payments to third parties as further described in Section 25 below.</p>

<p>The Services may also present you information relating to third party products or services (“Intuit Offers”) that you may be interested in. The Services may also provide you general tips, recommendations and educational material.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Account Information from Third Party Sites</strong></p>

<p>Users may direct Intuit to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-parties with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). Intuit works with one or more online service providers to access this Account Information. Intuit does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Intuit is not responsible for the Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites.</p>

<p>Intuit cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. Intuit cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Services, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Services, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.</p>

The Services may display Intuit Offers that may be custom matched to you based on information stored in the Services, queries made through the Services or other information. We may disclose when a particular Intuit Offer is sponsored or otherwise provided by a third party.</p>

<p>In connection with Intuit Offers, the Services will provide links to other web sites belonging to Intuit advertisers and other third parties. Intuit Offers are provided to you as a convenience. Intuit does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services available through the Intuit Offers (or any other third-party products or services advertised on or linked from our site), whether or not sponsored. Intuit is not an agent or broker or otherwise responsible for the activities or policies of those web sites. Intuit does not guarantee that the loan, investment, plan or other service terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser or other third party on the Sites are actually the terms that may be offered to you if you pursue the offer or that they are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. Information in the Intuit Offers are provided by the third parties, and any offer is subject to the third parties’ review of your information. Intuit may receive compensation from third parties which may impact the placement and availability of the Intuit Offers.</p>

<p><strong>21. Governing Law and Forum for Disputes</strong></p>

<p>California state law governs this Agreement without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.</p>

<p>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS OF USE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision; the arbitrator shall apply California law to all other matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND INTUIT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR LITIGATE ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</p>

<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Intuit Inc., in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Wilmington, DE 19808. Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules, but if you are unable to pay any of them, we will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such fees and costs for claims totaling less than $75,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek its attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Section 21 shall survive expiration, termination or rescission of this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>25. Bill Payment Services.</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><u>Description of Bill Payment Services</u>&nbsp;Intuit Payments Inc., a licensed money transmitter in required states, provides the bill payment service that allows you to make payments to bill payment providers. To be eligible to use the Bill Payment Services, you must be an individual resident of the United States (excluding its territories). You understand and acknowledge that our bill payment service is provided for individual consumer use only, and may not be used to make payments on behalf of a company, business/commercial enterprise, or another person. You further agree that you will only use the service to send bill payments on your own behalf and will not use the Bill Payment Services as an agent, guardian, conservator or guarantor for any other person or entity. In order to use the Bill Payment Services, you may need to provide us with your account information with service providers you choose (such as account passwords and usernames) and any information necessary for us to access your accounts with such service providers ("Bill Payment Account Information"). By using the Bill Payment Services, you expressly authorize Intuit Payments Inc. to access the Bill Payment Account Information, on your behalf and as your agent, solely for the purpose of providing the Bill Payment Services to you. Once you have added a service provider account, we will submit information, including usernames and passwords that you provide, to log you into the third party site (each, a "Third Party Site"). You hereby authorize and permit us to use and store your Bill Payment Account Information to accomplish the foregoing and to configure the Bill Payment Services so that they are compatible with the Third Party Sites for which you submit your Bill Payment Account Information. In some cases, we may display bills to you from your service providers who are also customers of Intuit’s other products or services.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value="2"><u>Description of Fees</u>&nbsp;There may be charges for certain transactions and services when you elect to use the Bill Payment Services. You agree to pay any fees for the Bill Payment Services you use or subscribe to as described on the Sites.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value="3"><u>Payee Information; Authority</u>&nbsp;By initiating a payment through the Bill Payment Services, you authorize Intuit Payments Inc. to charge the account that you designate as the account to which the bill payments should be charged or withdrawn from (the "Funding Account"). You agree to maintain a balance or available credit limit in the specified Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate. You represent and warrant that you have the right to authorize Intuit Payments Inc. to charge the Funding Account for payments you initiate using the Bill Payment Services. You will indemnify and hold Intuit harmless from any claims by any third party, including any other owner of the account related to Intuit Payments Inc.’s access to the Funding Account.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are responsible for confirming the accuracy of the information you provide about each payment you send, including the email/physical address or telephone number of the recipient (the "Payee"), and the amount of the transaction.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that Intuit Payments Inc. may send communication to the Payee on your behalf in connection with the Bill Payment Services. By using the Bill Payment Services, you represent and warrant that you and each person you identify have consented to receive ongoing communication, including text messages from us. Such communication may include messages, including text messages, to the recipient of the Bill Payment Services to receive money you had paid them using the Bill Payment Services. You agree to inform Intuit Payments Inc. if a person withdraws his consent to receiving text messages from you.</p>

<p>Intuit Payments Inc. does not charge a fee to send a text message when using the Bill Payment Services. However, any text messages sent and/or received are subject to standard text message rates depending on the recipient’s carrier and terms and conditions with the carrier. To stop receiving messages, reply STOP to any text messages you receive from us.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="4"><u>Limits On Payees, Payment Amounts And Methods</u>You acknowledge that certain Payees may not accept payment from all types of funding sources and that we may otherwise limit the payment methods available for a particular Payee. Additionally, Intuit Payments Inc. may, at its discretion, impose limits on the number and amount of payments, in aggregate, that you can send using the Bill Payment Services.</li>
</ol>

<p>Intuit Payments Inc. may refuse to permit payment to any Payee if we reasonably believe such refusal is necessary or advisable for legal or security reasons. If you fail to maintain a balance in the applicable Funding Account that is insufficient to fund any payment that you initiate, Intuit Payments Inc. may refuse to make any subsequent payment for as long as we determine to be necessary or appropriate. Intuit Payments Inc. also reserves the right to refuse to make any payment.</p>

<p>Intuit Payments Inc. reserves the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf, and the method to return funds to you in the event your Funding Account is closed or otherwise unavailable to us. The payment methods through the Bill Payment Services may include, but are not limited to, electronic or paper check payments, your designated credit card, or payment via other form of funds transfer that Intuit Payments Inc. may choose to employ. Payments to Payees outside of the United States, including its territories, are prohibited through the Bill Payment Services. The Bill Payment Services does not support payment to all types of billers, including certain government agencies and bills such as tax payments and court-ordered payments.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="5"><u>Rejected or Returned Payments.</u></li>
</ol>

<p>When you send a payment via the Bill Payment Services, the Payee is not required to accept it. You also understand that Payees, payment processors, or the mail/package delivery service providers may return payments to the Bill Payment Services for various reasons. These reasons can include, but are not limited to: the Payee’s forwarding address has expired; the Payee’s account number is not valid; the Payee is unable to locate the account; or your account with the Payee is paid in full. You agree that you will not hold Intuit liable for any damages resulting from a Payee not receiving payment made through the Bill Payment Services for any reason.</p>

<p>We use reasonable efforts to research and correct the returned payment and deliver it to your Payee. Payments outstanding after a reasonable time based on the method of payment may be automatically voided by Intuit Payments Inc. and the payment amount credited to your Funding Account. You are responsible for reconciling your Account(s) and reviewing the status of the payments. If we are unable to complete a payment for any reason, we may, in a method of our choosing and at our sole discretion, provide you with notice. We will, to the extent permitted by law, make reasonable attempts to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited or denied payments to your Funding Account, or use other reasonable efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="6"><u>Inability to Access Funds from Funding Account</u>&nbsp;In using the Bill Payment Services, you are requesting Mint Bills to facilitate making payments from your Funding Account(s) to your Payee(s). If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account to complete a bill payment transaction you request for any reason (for example, non-sufficient funds, closed account, inability to locate account, or reversal by you and/or your bank), the transaction may not be completed. If Bill Payment Service is unable to access funds from your specified Funding Account for any reason, you agree that:

	<ul>
		<li>you will reimburse Intuit Payments Inc. immediately, upon demand, the transaction amount to the extent that Intuit Payments Inc. sent a payment to the Payee on your behalf;</li>
		<li>you will reimburse Intuit Payments Inc. for any fees imposed on us as a result of the transaction;</li>
		<li>during the telephone call you make when you initiate payment for the Bill Payment Services you agree that Intuit Payments Inc. can rely on your verbal authorization for the payment method you select;</li>
		<li>you agree to give Intuit Payments Inc. permission to record the call should any dispute arise regarding the Intuit Payments Inc. Service; and</li>
		<li>you will reimburse the Bill Payment Services for any fees, including reasonable attorney fees, we incur in attempting to collect the amount of the transaction from you.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, you agree that Intuit Payments Inc. may: (a) reverse any corresponding credit or direct deposits issued to you; (b) reverse any payments Intuit Payments Inc. made to your Payee; (c) apply any money currently held by Intuit Payments Inc. to any amount owed to us; and (d) initiate electronic fund transfer from your account to collect any unpaid amounts and our fees.</p>

<p>Intuit Payments Inc. is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or available credit in the Funding Account that is sufficient to fund all payments you initiate.</p>

<p>If Intuit Payments Inc. is not able to recover all amounts owed to us, we may report this information to third parties, including consumer reporting agencies and financial institutions. Intuit reserves all rights to pursue all available legal remedies to recover all owed amounts.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="7"><u>Your Liability</u>&nbsp;You are solely liable for errors you make in using the Bill Payment Services, including the following:

	<ul>
		<li>you direct Intuit Payments Inc. to submit a payment to a Payee from the wrong Funding Account;</li>
		<li>you erroneously direct Intuit Payments Inc. to submit a payment to a Payee multiple times;</li>
		<li>you direct Intuit Payments Inc. to submit the wrong amount to a Payee;</li>
		<li>you direct Intuit Payments Inc. to submit a payment to the wrong Payee; or</li>
		<li>you change your mind about making a payment to a Payee after directing Intuit Payments Inc. to submit the payment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>You are responsible for all fees, fines, penalties, and other liability incurred by Intuit, a Payee, you or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this Agreement and/or your use of the Bill Payment Services. You agree to reimburse Intuit, a Payee or the applicable third party for any and all such liability.</p>

<p>In the event that you are liable for any amounts owed to Intuit for a payment you authorized through the Bill Payment Services, Intuit Payments Inc. may immediately remove such amounts from or charge such amounts to your applicable Funding Account. If the applicable Funding Account does not have funds or available credit sufficient to cover your liability, you will be required to immediately add funds to the Funding Account or otherwise provide payment to Intuit through other means. If you do not do so, Intuit may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.</p>

<p>Intuit does not have control of, or liability for, the products or services that are paid for via the Bill Payment Services.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="8">As permitted, you may cancel, edit, or stop a payment prior to the pay date by following the directions within the help section of the Bill Payment Service. Our ability to stop a payment request will depend on the manner in which the payment was initiated, the method of payment, and whether or not the Payee has begun processing payment. Although we will make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment request, we will have no liability for failing to do so unless there is an exception provided elsewhere in this Agreement. We may also require you to present your stop payment request in writing after contacting customer care. The charge for each stop payment will be the current charge for such stop payment and fund recovery service as set out in any applicable fee schedule or as disclosed through the site.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value="9"><u>Delays, Unauthorized Transactions, or Errors</u>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Payment Processing Delays and Protection for Late Fees.</strong>&nbsp;You acknowledge that some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account with the applicable Payee due to circumstances beyond Intuit Payments Inc.' control, such as delays in handling and posting payments by Payees or financial institutions or errors with account information or funding instructions.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:1in;">When you send a payment to certain Payees, the payment may be treated as an authorization to the Payee to process your payment and complete the transaction. Some Payees may delay processing your payment, in which case the payment may be held as pending until the Payee processes your payment and your payment authorization will remain valid for up to 30 days.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in;">To help ensure that there is enough time for the applicable Payee to receive any payments you submit through the Bill Payment Services, you should submit payment instructions prior to the due date. Before completing the transaction, you will be provided with an estimated delivery date for the bill payment. It is solely your responsibility to submit payments so they arrive by the Payee's due date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in;">Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Intuit Payments Inc. will bear responsibility for any satisfactorily documented late payment related charges up to a reasonable amount, not to exceed $50.00 in the event a payment posts after its due date provided that (i) the payment was submitted by you for payment in accordance with the guidelines specified in this Section and (ii) the Bill Payment Services issued you a confirmation number for a payment, unless we are not responsible to you for one of the reasons listed in this section or below under "Protection for Intuit Payments Inc. Errors." THIS IS INTUIT’S ONLY OBLIGATION TO YOU FOR ANY PAYMENT ERRORS, DELAYS, OR FAILURE. IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE RULES OR IF YOU DO NOT ALLOW ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE A PAYMENT, YOU ALONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PENALTIES OR LATE CHARGES ON THAT PAYMENT.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="2"><strong>Errors or other Issues Regarding Payments.</strong>&nbsp;It is your responsibility to review all payment transactions initiated in the Bill Payment Services against account statements you receive from your bank or other financial institution. Your payment transaction information is included in the receipts we provide you. ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH THE BILL PAYMENT SERVICES MUST BE DIRECTED TO INTUIT PAYMENTS INC., AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT. We are responsible for our Bill Payment Services and for resolving any errors we caused.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-left:1in;">We may not send you a periodic statement listing transactions that you make using the Bill Payment Services. The transactions will appear only on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution. SAVE THE RECEIPTS FROM OUR BILL PAYMENT SERVICES, AND CHECK THEM AGAINST THE ACCOUNT STATEMENT YOU RECEIVE FROM YOUR BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1in;">IF YOUR CREDENTIALS TO ACCESS THE BILL PAYMENT SERVICES OR YOUR MOBILE DEVICE ARE LOST OR STOLEN, NOTIFY US AT ONCE USING THE CONTACT METHODS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 6 OF ARTICLE I (GENERAL TERMS) ABOVE.</p>

<ol>
	<li value="3"><strong>Protection for Intuit Payments Inc. Errors.</strong>&nbsp;Intuit Payments Inc. will use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the payment of your bills in accordance with this Agreement. However, Intuit will not be liable, for instance:

	<ul>
		<li>if, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Funding Account to make the transfer;</li>
		<li>the payment is rejected, returned, mishandled, or delayed by the Payee for any reason;</li>
		<li>you have provided Intuit Payments Inc. with incorrect information about the Payee;</li>
		<li>the Funding Account you specify as the payment source is closed or the charge is rejected or returned by your bank or financial institution;</li>
		<li>due to any pre-announced unavailability of the Bill Payment Services;</li>
		<li>due to fraud or attacks on our systems, service or the Bill Payment Services;</li>
		<li>due to third party service providers; or</li>
		<li>due to circumstances beyond our control (for example, fire, flood, interference from an outside source, postal delays, or any failure by your computer, software, or Internet connection).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li value="4"><strong>Unauthorized Transactions.</strong>&nbsp;If you have experienced a billing error or unauthorized transaction related to bill payment services, please see the&nbsp;<a href="efta_policy.blade.php" target="_blank">Mint Unauthorized Transaction and Error Resolution Policy</a>. For unauthorized transfers and errors with respect to your credit card or debit card that are not related to the Bill Payment Services, please see your applicable card holder agreement.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value="10"><u>Risk Monitoring; Unusual or Suspicious Transactions</u>&nbsp;In an effort to manage our risk, we may monitor your transactions and processing activity for high-risk practices or for fraudulent transactions. We may also engage third-party service providers to assist in these efforts and other elements of the Bill Payment Services. If Intuit Payments Inc. believes there is suspicious or unusual activity, Intuit Payments Inc. may temporarily suspend your access to Bill Payment Services. Suspicious or unusual activity includes, but is not limited to, changes in your average transaction amount or processing pattern or use of different payment accounts. Intuit Payments Inc. may require additional documentation to promptly reinstate your access to the Bill Payment Services.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li value="11"><u>Termination</u>&nbsp;Intuit Payments Inc. may terminate or suspend your access to the Bill Payment Services at any time. Neither termination nor suspension shall affect your liability or obligations under this Agreement. In the event you or Intuit Payments Inc. terminates your account, any payment(s) Intuit Payments Inc. has already processed before the requested termination date may be completed. You should verify payment directly with your intended Payee. Intuit Payments Inc. is not responsible for any payments not completed by us as a result of termination.</li>
